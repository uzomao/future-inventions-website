  "body": "Join us for the second offering in our Winter/Spring Programming, a salon exploring the theme of Ancestral Technologies. In recent years, there’s been a push to remember and conceptualize non-western lineages of science& technology. Terms such as ancestral technology, indigenous technology and[ Lo-TEK](https://www.taschen.com/en/books/architecture-design/04698/julia-watson-lo-tek-design-by-radical-indigenism/) are increasingly common with artists, technologists, and theorists actively producing work to expand the history of technological advancement and highlight what culturally-informed innovation looks like today.\n\nIt’s only fitting that we look back to move forward and so we are hosting this session to generate discussion around what exactly is an ancestral technology and what this means in practice.\n\n**How is this going to go?**\n\nWe’ll begin with an overview of the theme and unlike the previous reading group, instead of choosing one or two central texts, we will have a curated selection of conversation-starters in the form of visual aides, quotes/excerpts, prompt cards , and note-taking material to encourage rich conversation. The room will be set up in conversation stations and attendees will accordingly be assigned into small groups to move through both. After small group discussion, there will be a larger share-out. We will close with a speculative design activity informed by our learnings. All of this will be explained further on the day.\n\n**No pre-reading or preparation necessary!** If you are curious, we have collated these resources:[ https://www.are.na/decolonize-the-art-world/future-inventions-ancestral-technologies](https://www.are.na/decolonize-the-art-world/future-inventions-ancestral-technologies)\n\n**If you would like to learn more beforehand, here's a few stand-outs**\n\n**EXPLORE:**\n\n* [An African Design Canon](https://www.instagram.com/an.african.design.canon/)\n* [Zambezi Radical Archives](https://www.instagram.com/zambeziradicalarchives/?hl=en)\n* [Achebe's Internet: Proverbial Protocol](https://www.akademie-solitude.de/de/web-residencies/calls-2022/magical-hackerism-or-the-elasticity-of-resilience/achebes-internet-proverbial-protocol/)\n\n**READ:**\n\n* [Towards New Metaphors of Consciousness](https://contemporaryand.com/magazines/towards-new-metaphors-of-consciousness/) by Enos Nyamor\n* [What else can technology be? : Uzoma Orji in conversation with Kombo Chapfika](https://www.akademie-solitude.de/de/solitude-blog/what-else-can-technology-be/)\n* [From the Sasha into the Zamani: Death as a Moment of Radical Continuity](https://logicmag.io/supa-dupa-skies/from-the-sasha-into-the-zamani-death-as-a-moment-of-radical-continuity/) by Zainab Aliyu\n* [On Remembering: Conceptualizing “Ancestral Malaise” and Its Relationship to Quantum Technology](https://inkmcneill.medium.com/on-remembering-conceptualizing-ancestral-malaise-and-its-relationship-to-quantum-technology-509bfdf99399) by ink mcneill\n\n**WATCH:**\n\n* [In Conversation: Legacy Russell & Salome Asega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxELKO5Jjok)\n* [The Fractals at the Heart of African Design](https://www.ted.com/talks/ron_eglash_the_fractals_at_the_heart_of_african_designs) - Ron Eglash\n\n**LISTEN:**\n\nPodcast Episode:[ Indigenous Tech, Indigenous Knowledge: Wampum.codes as a model for decolonization](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72RDwjryRW2NziOT6effgg) - Spotify (and on several other platforms)",
