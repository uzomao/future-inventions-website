  "body": "Welcome to our online session of the month, ending November's Intro to Digital Colonialism explorations. In this workshop, we will hold space for any reflections following the in-person reading groups in London and Abuja and allow those in both spaces to meet like-minded individuals across the atlantic. If you are based elsewhere, please still join! The research materials for this month are both free to access online[ here](https://www.are.na/decolonize-the-art-world/intro-to-digital-colonialism) so you can follow along.\n\nTo kick-off the design aspect of Future Inventions, we will spend this session collectively writing a manifesto for Afro-Technological Futures. This will be an ongoing/open-source document outlining our principles and commitments, informed by our understanding of digital colonialism/resistance and technological sovereignty. No pressure! **This is a relaxed session for discussion and thinking through what next steps we can take to incorporate these learning into our individual and collective work and lives.**\n\nLet's shape a future where technology is designed to support our specific contexts. See you there!\n\nCover Image Credit: African Fractals: Modern Computing and Indigenous Design, Ron Eglash",
