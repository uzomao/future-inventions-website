It’s still way under what we need but this is a first step into making this work more sustainable. **Tickets are Pay-What-You-Can between £5-12 with a few free tickets reserved for those who are currently unwaged or cannot afford to attend otherwise.** We do not want this to cause a financial barrier to anyone so even if the limited free tickets run out, please email us.\n\n\n\n\n**How is this going to go?**\n\nWe will start with a brief presentation and then move into groups for collaboration and discussion. Then, using printed artworks, we will take you through how images are categorised, creating ‘rules’ and producing new knowledge based off of an existing dataset. **No familiarity or experience with AI or human-computer interaction is needed!**\n\nPlease reach out to us via email at futureinventionslab@gmail.com or DM @futureinventions.lab on instagram with any questions.\n\n\n\n\nEvent Page, [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/intro-to-ai-how-machines-think-virtual-tickets-1844920309309?aff=oddtdtcreator)\n\n\n\n\nRefunds: This is a small team and so we cannot accommodate refunds but if plans change, let us know as soon as you can and we can add your ticket to the waitlist or share it online to try and pass it on to someone else",
