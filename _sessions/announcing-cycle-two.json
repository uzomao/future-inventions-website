We are pleased to announce our Autumn 2025 - Spring 2026 cycle, a series of educational events dedicated to demystifying AI through an artistic lens and offering critical perspectives on this rapidly growing yet largely unchecked technology. [52% ](https://future-inventions.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=4b38eb6681f8e1cfa44c76f88&id=b5129941f2&e=96158be136)of adults report a fear of how AI might negatively impact them - and for good reason too. This season, we want to dedicate time to educating ourselves on how this technology is developed and functions. To be clear, we are not pro-AI or advocating for its use. We believe that technology is a reflection of its maker and to reimagine invention outside of the frameworks that Big Tech impose, more people need to be informed and involved in these conversations around technology - a sphere which has historically been white, male, and tied to class. This is why we’ve designed the upcoming cycle to explore the basics and get into counter/experimental uses of AI as well.\n\nLook out for details and registration for our November sessions.",
