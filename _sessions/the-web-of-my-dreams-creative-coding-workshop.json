In this introductory coding workshop, you will be guided in creating a simple website that reflects your vision of a digital oasis/garden.\n\n**How is this going to go?**\n\nWeâ€™ll begin by introducing Future Invention's March theme: The Experimental Web, and unpack related terms such as the small web, personal internet and digital gardens. From here, participants will be guided in three smaller groups to first sketch and then code their own space using basic HTML and CSS. This will be using a template and all confirmed participants will be sent an email beforehand with instructions on a software to download beforehand, and a folder with material that we will build on in the workshop.\n\n**No experience necessary!**\n\nPlease reach out to us via email at futureinventionslab@gmail.com or DM @futureinventions.lab on instagram with any questions.\n\nHeader Image: [Betelhem Makonnen](https://betelhemmakonnen.com/), *conjugated keyboard* (2020)",
