This critically acclaimed film follows Jones and her collaborator, Olivia McKayla Ross, as they search for the real-life woman who served as the face of Mavis Beacon, the fictional instructor in the widely used typing software[ *Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mavis_Beacon_Teaches_Typing)*.*\n\nJoin us on April 13th at 1:30pm to watch the film, which will be followed by a guided discussion around archival justice, digital fugitivity and the relationship between race, care work, and technology. This also happens to be the first time Seeking Mavis Beacon is being screened publicly in the U.K outside of the BFI Film Festival last October so we are honoured to be able to bring it to our community for free!\n\nLight refreshments will be provided and there will be an intermission. Limited spaces available so please RSVP. A few days before you will also be asked to confirm your space to ensure numbers/release additional tickets if needed.\n\nAt the venue there is also an exhibition of painter Jake Grewal’s latest body of work which will be open from 10am, so feel free to get there earlier if you’d like to check it out!
